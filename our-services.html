                    Leave a little time to proofread and edit your essay. Your essay 
                    should be 4-5 paragraphs in length. It will be rated in terms of 
                    organization, grammar, vocabulary, and coherence.

                <p>Some offices allow employees to listen to music, while others do not. 
                  I think that employers should not allow workers to listen to music at 
                  the office because it causes distraction, hurts teamwork and easily 
                  leads to disagreeableness. Based in your opinion, are you agree or disagree

                  Hello. I've been looking at the photo gallery of your online home
                  buyer's ad. Congratulations on trying to sell your home without 
                  a real estate agent. It is difficult (we have done it twice) but
                  is worth the effort if you find a reasonable buyer. My sister is
                  interested in buying a home in your region. Your home could be
                  ideal if you are willing to negotiate the price. Your asking
                  price is about $10, 000 above her budget. She also wants to
                  live near an elementary school and a bus route. I'm not sure
                  if your home is near these amenities. Could you let me know
                  about these details? Most importantly, are you open to 
                  negotiation on the price? Please let me know when the house
                  would be available for viewing.
                  <br>
                  Thank you.
                  Sincerely,

                  or can't negotiate the price.</p>
